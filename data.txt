I don't want nobody when I got your body
I got my favorite girl. Not feeling no pain no fear don't have a care in the world. Why would I when you are here?
I will never say never! (I will fight)/ I will fight till forever! (make it right)/ Whenever you knock me down/ I will not stay on the ground
I wish we had another time. I wish we had another place. But everything we have is stuck in the moment. And there's nothing my heart can do to fight with time and space. Because I'm still stuck in the moment with you.
I’m a really claustrophobic person to begin with. I hate elevators especially crammed elevators. Except if it is you and me.
I'd wait on you forever and a day hand and foot your world is my world.
If I could just die in your arms I wouldn't mind.
If I was your boyfriend I'd never let you go I can take you places you ain't never been before.

And I'm in pieces baby fix me. And just shake me 'til you wake me from this bad dream. I'm going down down down down. And I just can't believe my first love won't be around.
Oh I can't help it I'm just selfish/ There's no way that I could share you/ That would break my heart to pieces/ Honestly the truth is…/ If I could just die in your arms/ I wouldn't mind.
Oh it's supposed to be some give and take I know. But you're only taking and not giving anymore. So what do I do? Because I still love you… And you're the only one who can save me.
Only if you give give your first dance to me/ Girl I promise I'll be gentle/ I know we gotta do it slowly/ If you give (give it) give the first dance to me (give it)/ I'm going cherish every moment/ because it only happens once once in a lifetime
So crazy is this thing we call love. And now that we've got it we just can't give up.
So don't fear. Don't you worry about a thing. I am here by you (I'll never let you go).
Step to the beat of my heart/ I don't need a whole lot/ But for you I admit I/ I'd rather give you the world/ Or we can share mine/ I know I won't be the first one/ giving you all this attention/ Baby listen/ I just need somebody to love.
Take my hand. Let's just dance. Watch my feet. Follow me. Don't be scared girl I'm here. If you didn't know this is love.
Tell me what you like yeah tell me what you don't/ I could be your Buzz Lightyear fly across the globe.
There's a dream that I've been chasing. Want so badly for it to be reality. And when you hold my hand and I understand that it's meant to be. Because baby when you're with me it's like an angel came by and took me to heaven. Because when I stare in your eyes it couldn't be better
They say that hate has been sent so let loose the talk of love. Before they outlaw the kiss baby give me one last hug.

Education is a progressive discovery of your own ignorance.
Education is what remains when one has forgotten everything he learned in school.
EVERYTHING you do is with honors.
For a quick and relaxing study break I suggest screwing me in the stacks.
Girl you're a 4.0.
Go for it now. The future is promised to no one.
Graduation celebrate school is done look out world here I come.
Graduation is a tough day for parents. They go to the ceremony as parents. They go home as contemporaries. After twenty-two years they are unemployed.
Have you ever visited the deserted shelves in the main library? Want to?
Hey boy let me get your number — you haven’t shown up to our group-project meetings in weeks.
Hey boy let’s kiss … our perfect GPAs goodbye after that Chemistry final.
Hey girl I’d like to take you out … of library because you’re making too much noise.
Hey girl let’s exchange emails — I need you on my Google Doc.
High School is a lot like toilet paper you only miss it when its gone.
I can't wait to fall out of touch with everyone I've met in college except for you.
I found a stick in the bush!
I graduated Magna Cum...
I graduated. So now I'm like smart and stuff.
I have been in love with you every day since day one in school.
I have never let my schooling interfere with my sex life.
I may be graduating with a 2.4 GPA but I got a 4.0 in treading the ladies riiiiight.
I may not have made valedictorian but today could still be a valedictory if you go out with me.
I think sleeping was my problem in school. If school had started at 4:00 in the afternoon I'd be a college graduate today.
I tripped on the walk to receive my diploma and fell in love with you.
I want to see you outside English — you take the best notes in the whole class.
I went commando to my graduation.
I'd like to thank my parents for getting me here and the boy in the second row with the floppy hair for getting me home.
I'm graduating today! How about a graduation kiss? [Are you really graduating today?] No but how about a kiss anyway?
I’m cap and you are gown we just fit together.
If I look tired it's because I've been studying you all night long.
If my exams were as easy as having sex with you I'd be getting 100% scores on all my papers.
If someone was to write a story about my life the climax would be our graduation when you agree to go out with me.
If you can find a path with no obstacles it probably doesn't lead anywhere.
If you ever need a compliment or a kidney call me.
If you live to be one hundred you've got it made. Very few people die past that age.
In the first place God made idiots that was for practice then he made school boards.
Is that a diploma in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?
It was only when I finished the course and left my graduation diploma on the bus that I realized I'd become an actor.
Just graduated. It is time for graduation sex.
Let's commemorate our own personal academic achievements.
Let’s play professor and student — you practice giving me a C and I’ll practice crying at your office hours.
Let’s sleep together … on the couches in Bechtel so that we don’t have to leave the library.
May your finals be as easy as you are.
My school was so tough the school newspaper had an obituary section.
Nice to finally meet all of you.
One thing about the school of experience is that it will repeat the lesson if you flunk the first time.
The advantage of a classical education is that it enables you to despise the wealth that it prevents you from achieving..
The direction in which education starts a man will determine his future.
The fact that no one understands you doesn't make you an artist...
The roots of education are bitter but the fruit is sweet.
The trouble with learning from experience is that you never graduate.
There are no shortcuts to any place worth going.
There is a good reason they call these ceremonies 'commencement exercises'. Graduation is not the end it's the beginning – of our relationship.
They call me 'The Dean.' And I just put you on my list.
Wanna help me earn some extracurricular activity points?
Wanna pull an all-nighter with me?

I don’t care if anyone believes me. I am not gonna stop looking for you until I find you and bring you home! I am going to you home!
I found the chocolate pudding! And I want more of where that stuff came from.
I like it cold let's get naked.
I like you more than the amount of salt it took to make Eleven's sensory deprivation pool.
I Noah a girl who wants to date you.
I once cut my chin open on a desk by doing a cartwheel while dancing.
I ship us more than Finn ships Mileven.
If we were walkie talkies you'd be in my range.
If we’re both going crazy then we’ll go crazy together right?
If you are the Demogorgon call me blood.
I'll be the eggo to your Eleven.
Is your name 11? Cause I'll make you enjoy some Stranger Things experience.
Is your name Nancy? Because I’m going to take creepy pictures of you from a distance while you’re in your room.
Let's get coffee and contemplate our future relationship.
Let's make it a one time…two time thing.
Let's study.
Maybe they should call you Mirkwood because I wanna ride you at night.
Mornings are for coffee and contemplation.
My love for you is bigger than Barb's glasses.
No pick up lines can make you Dustin' me away.
Noah? More like Woah.
Oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god.
On a scale of 1-10 you are an 11.
Out of two you are an 11 matching with me seems upside down. But I have seen much stranger things.
So I heard you like toothless frog-faces at midnight?
So I am really good at the pull-out?
The space in my heart for you is bigger than the space in Dustin's teeth.
There’s more to life than stupid boys you know. You are ready for a man in you.
We are totally not a thing like catch on.
We will date.
We're Not in Hawkins Anymore ready for some Fawking?
When I see you I think 'what? No! ew gross!.'
Why are you keeping this curiosity door locked? Let me help you open it up.
Why do we even need weapons anyway. You have me.
Wow. She looks…—Pretty… Good. You look pretty good.
You act like you’re all alone out there in the world but you’re not. You’re not alone.
You are finger-lickin’ good.
You don't need a will to love me.
You must love Stranger Things because Luc-at that -ass
You’re going to take out a Demogorgon with a slingshot? No I am going to do with the rocket in my pants.
Your virginity will disappear faster than Eleven did.
You're one in a mill-ie-on.
You're the table to my Dustin's fists.Are you a Great War? Because you must leave men my age devastated.
Are you distantly related? If so that's hot.
Are you from Tennessee? Because that would be a disappointment. Americans are brusque.
Are you quite well my lady?
Are you wearing several layers of uncomfortable undergarments or are you always this hot?
At my age one must ration one's excitement
Footmen give good foot rubs.
Get those lumps...in my tea.
Hey girl do my eyes deceive me or are those pants you're wearing?
Hey girl let's start a revolution in your pants.
Hey lady I feel no need to conform to the aristocratic custom of hiring a valet when I have you to undress me with your eyes.
I cannot find the words to say how I feel.
I have a really hot personality.
I just got a telephone give me your number and I'll call you once I figure this contraption out.
I know we're related but at least you're not a dead Turk or Jordan Mormont.
I know you want some of this Yorkshire pudding.
I like to wear pants. I also like to take them off.
I run a tight ship in bed.
I spread socialism... not herpes.
I'd fancy being beneath you physically in addition to socially.
I'm a lamb in the streets but a freak in the sheets.
If being sexy was a crime you'd be unfairly charged put on death row and saved at the last minute because I never gave up on you.
If you're turning American on me I'll go downstairs.
Is that a mirror in your afternoon dress? Because I can see myself in it much to the dismay of your noble family.
Let's conspire to bang.
Let's crumpet after dinner.
Let's do it. Then I'll remake the bed. Then we can do it again.
Let's watch Downton Abbey and pretend the rest of the world doesn't exist.
Might I be so bold as to say that I think your 'Downstairs' is quite 'Upstairs.'
No life appears rewarding if you think too much about it.
No man can regret loving as I have loved you
Pardon me but I seem to lost my phone number. Can I have yours so my valet can hold on to it until I wish for him to call you on my behalf?
Seems a pity to miss such a good pudding
These blue eyes tell no lies. You're hot.
Was your father a baker due to the fact that he was not born into an aristocratic family and thus being a tradesman was his only viable career option? Because you've got nice buns.
We don't need any of this newfangled electricity to make sparks fly.
What is a weekend?
Why? Don't you want me?
You can dowager count-on-me.
You don't watch Downton Abbey? How middle class dear.
You know what they say. The bigger the sense of honor the bigger the...
You just lie there and I King Leonidas will impale you with my spear.
I don't exactly know what I am required to say in order for you to have intercourse with me. But could we assume that I said all that. I mean essentially we are talking about fluid exchange right? So could we go just straight to the sex?
I find you attractive. Your aggressive moves toward me... indicate that you feel the same way. But still ritual requires that we continue with a number of platonic activities...before we have sex. I am proceeding with these activities but in point of actual fact all I really want to do is have intercourse with you as soon as possible.
Marry me and I'll never look at another horse.
I have always depended on the kindness of strangers.
Fasten your seatbelts. It's going to be a bumpy night.
I don't know how to put this but I'm kind of a big deal.
Let's hop on the good foot and do the bad thing.
They don't call me thumper for nothing!
I have crossed oceans of time to find you.
I don't think you're an idiot at all. I mean there are elements of the ridiculous about you. Your mother's pretty interesting. And you really are an appallingly bad public speaker. And um you tend to let whatever's in your head come out of your mouth without much consideration of the consequences...but the thing is um what I'm trying to say very inarticulately is that um in fact perhaps despite appearances I like you very much. Just as you are.
Here's looking at you kid.
Was that cannon fire or is it my heart pounding?
I don't bite you know... unless it's called for
Do you have a cell phone I could use? Why? Someone has to call God and tell him that one of his angels is missing.
Someone has to call God and tell him that one of his angels is missing.
Hey I would like to introduce my Crouching Tiger to your Hidden Dragon
Carpe diem. Seize the day boys. Make your lives extraordinary.
Nobody puts Baby in a corner.
Go ahead make my day.
They say Disney world is the happiest place on earth obviously they haven't been in your arms.
The difference between me and Django....This D ain't silent.
There's no reason we need to be shackled by the strictures of the employee-employer relationship. Unless you're into that sort of thing. In which case I got some shackles in the back. I'm just kidding. But seriously I've got 'em.
I hate to see you go but I love to watch you leave.
Now put your clothes back on and I'll buy you an ice cream
We're just like peas and carrots
Well this is a very stupid question and particularly in view of our recent shopping excursion but I just wondered by any chance erm er I mean obviously not because I guess I've only slept with nine people b-but I just wondered er I really feel um in short to recap it slightly in a clearer version er in the words of David Cassidy in fact er - while he was still with the Partridge family um I think I love you and er I just wondered if by any chance you wouldn't like to er er no no no of course not... I'm an idiot he's not...excellent excellent fantastic um I was going to say lovely to see you sorry to disturb...better get on.
Hello gorgeous.
I couldn't help but notice that you look a lot like my next girlfriend.
Your husband told me you were the most beautiful woman he'd ever seen but he didn't say anything about the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen.
We live in a cynical world. A cynical world. And we work in a business of tough competitors. I love you. You…complete me.
You're prettier than I am.

Were you forged in the fires of Mount Doom? Because you're precious to me.
Boy: Are you the mother of Mary-Kate and Ashley Olson? Girl: No. Why? Boy: Because you sure got some good looking twins. (points to her boobs)
I see you're drinking 1%. Is that 'cause you think you're fat? 'Cause you're not. You could be drinking whole if you wanted to
You give me premature ventricular contractions... You make my heart skip a beat.
What if uh Mr. Thacker realized that he had been a daft p***k and got down on his knees and begged you to reconsider if you would...indeed...reconsider.
Listen to me mister. You're my knight in shining armor. Don't you forget it. You're going to get back on that horse and I'm going to be right behind you holding on tight and away we're gonna go go go!
If I had Jack Sparrow's compass it'd be pointing at you.
I'll be your farm boy if you'll be my princess bride
Mind if I get drunk with you?
Your pussy is in more danger than a seal during Shark Week.
If I was a Jedi would you be my force?
Roses are red Yoda is green my lightsaber needs two hands if you know what I mean
Want to make my Dark Knight Rise?
Why don't we head to my bedroom peel back my Star War sheets and discover what a true Jedi can do with his light sabre?
Your mouth says 'Shields Up'. But your eyes say 'Hull breach imminent'
There's something I want to say that's always been very difficult for me to say. ‘I slit the sheet the sheet I slit and on the slitted sheet I sit.' There. I've never been relaxed enough around anyone to say that.
I am big! It's the pictures that got small.

I'd like to kiss you but I just washed my hair.

Here y'are baby. Take this wipe the lipstick off slide over here next to me and let's get started.
Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.
How would you like to have a sexual experience so intense it could conceivably change your political views?
You know how they say we only use 10 percent of our brains I think we only use 10 percent of our hearts.
God you're a real live outlaw! I may be the outlaw but you're the one stealing my heart.
You must be worthy 'cause you can totally lift my hammer.
I'm the king of the world!
You remind me of my sketchbook I wanna fill it up with drawings just like I wanna fill up your life with love!
You don't have to say anything... Oh maybe just whistle. You know how to whistle don't you?
Take me to bed or lose me forever
Hi I'm Andy. Wanna play with my Woody?
