In the evening I should have worn my sandals, but instead I wore my slippers. What a lovely pair of shoes you have!
When you are done with me, I will not be there to give you your hands on Saturdays.
Why don't you and your friend visit my old red barn? We could use those hands to paint the barn black and grey, and then maybe I'll buy you a drink and help you paint the barn white?
You and me, we would go perfectly together.
You are the light of my morning sky.
You don't have to work. You can be my sugar; I know how to grind my weed.
You don't have to work. You can be my sunshine.
You look good in that space.
You look good on the beach, though, you look even better on the bedroom floor.
You make me want to be a better cook.
You're hair is gray, your nails black and your eyes blue. Your face is brown and twisted. Where do you come from? How long have you been waiting for your daddy?
You're so beautiful, I could name all the 7 continents.
You're so pretty, I bet you could change my world.
You're so sweet, I could put you on a pedestal.
A: I'm having trouble getting this lightsaber to light up. Can you give me directions to a nearby Industrial? B: Where? Baking Soda factory? B: I want to give you a real solar array. B: Are you the mother of Princess Leia? B: No, why?
Anakin Skywalker -  Anakin Skywalker!
And with the Force he became Darth Vader, ready to pummel his enemies!
Are you the mother of Princess Leia? B: No, why?
Can you help me find something? When I saw you, my heart was painted black and gray, and I even started smelling your mat, floor and walls!
Do you have a map? Because I just keep getting lost in your eyes!
I could take you to infinity plus one but I'd rather let you stick with me, knowing you can take me to the end!
I could spend a thousand years in your toilet but I won't.
I hope you like Star Wars, because there's one thing I want to make sure you don't miss.
I love a man with three little pigs and two little hams.
I'll put my helmet back on 'cause I just saw my castle crumble.
I'm a man who wears space suits but I'm not the only one who wears space pants.
I'm not a big fan of your backpack, it's too small.
I'm not here to judge you, but your beauty is making other girls like me.
I'm not looking for argument. I'm just asking you out.
I'm looking for explosion... wanna explode?
I'm very thirsty and need a supply of faucet-type thing to water your plants.
I'm not Yuuzhan Vong.
I've been thinking about you a latin peasant girl.
I'm not sure what you do, but your beauty makes me want to die a million deaths.
If I can change your name, I will give you eternal life.
If I told you you were a beauty, would you name me after you?
If I was a fang, would you use your 'black swan' to roast my ass?
If I were to build a house with you, would you be my 'handyman'?
If I was to leave my happy ending lying there, I'd throw my softcover book at the ground.
If I were to run away, I'd run away straight to your side!
If I were to live, I'd live forever in your heart.
If I were to run away, I'd run away straight to your side!
If I were to look at you, I would swear I saw my 'destroyer' inside your pants!
If I were to run away, I'd run away straight to your side!
If I were to live forever, you wouldn't be my only one.
If I were to run away, I'd run away straight to your side!
If I were to live forever, you wouldn't be the only one.
If I were to run away, I'd run away straight to your side!
If I were to live forever, you wouldn't be the only one.
If I were to run away, I'd run away straight to your side!
If I were to run away, I'd run away straight to your side!
If I were to live forever, you wouldn't be the only one.
If I were to run away, I'd run away straight to your side!
If I were to run away, I'd run away straight to your side!

It's a pretty cool idea, I know, but it's kind of a red herring.
It's not a bad idea. It could be a great idea. But it's not the kind of idea I was hoping to have with you.
Just like the early stages of cancer, once you've been through a few rounds of chemo you're cured.
Just like evolution, we're going to have to keep doing weird stuff with our lives, but somehow it will all work out.
Let's cross pollinate... let's make a baby.
Let's pretend I'm Buddha for tonight.
My cervix isn't the only thing that's expanding right now.
My uterus is no longer the only place I'm gonna be getting u.
My skin is cancerous. It needs to be removed.
My thought is the same as the thought of cancer: useless right now, but when I think of u it gives me cancer.
And it's not just the cervix that's getting expanded.
Ponder that thought for a minute. What if we expand it out again?
Ponder that thought again. If we were old enough together, maybe we could do it sometime.
Put on your skates and let's roll!
Wanna do it on the pool deck?
Wanna see my rat?
Want to help the little guy out?

Wow, I've never seen such a large fish growing out of a single leaf.

Opening, I should say a word or two about the chemistry of platonic love.
Should I excite this reaction or cool this one?
Taking off my clothes just doesn't compare to what I would do for you
The only question I would ask is this: Would you like to form an alliance?
Why do you need to pull out all the stops to make the cut?
You don't need to worry about any of this chemistry.
A quick little trip to your laboratory might yield some useful results.
Alright, I've got your solution and your periodic table. Let's get cracking.
Are you tired? Because you've been running through my mind all day. You must be a professor, because you're a professor.
We are anhydrous ammonia to be exact.
I think you need a cane to steady yourself.
Are you a professor? Because you have been holding my attention all night.
Why don't you give me a ride of your life?
I would like to thank my mentor for throwing me a curveball.
Let's go back to my place and find the hyperfine structure of covalent bond.
What do you say we go back to my dorm room and analyze some more of that chiral loop?
Let's duplicate this reaction.
I can't duplicate this reaction, but I can make you hotter.
Your body has the potential to be a Terahertz Amplifier.
This reaction must be the one.
A quick base-collapse accelerometer would be super useful here.

I'd like to expand my black hole by a factor of 10.
Let's call it a 1-π constant so we can investigate its reaction sooner.

I love you bro!
I wish my parents were as great as Drake's dad.
I'd love to have you for dinner… and then see you take that monster to work.
I'd have to agree with Drake. You are the most beautiful girl here.
I'm feeling my age, and you've got the last calendar month and a half of my life to live.
I'm going to date you like I would love to go to court and wed.
I'm not being provocative, but you have a lovely body.
I'm sorry, I think I owe you a beer. You and I are so obsessed with this person.
If you were a courtesan, I'd be the one giving you blow jobs.
Is this a belt buckle? If not, then how do you get it in there?
Let me see your Cincinatti's... (Hold out hand) ...and I'll take you out to ...the ghetto?

Let me teach you something about sex…and bondage
Let me tell you something about bondage: You are mine by midnight.

Let's nap…in the back of a limo.
Let's give you a real sadist: fucking you senseless doesn’t even make you sound dirty!

I want to bang you as often as possible!
I'm not trying to impress you or anything, but I was just curious.
Is it true that 1 in 4 men is a rapist?
Is that a banana in your pants or you just a compliment?
Is that an earring in your ear, or are you just happy to see me?
It's true! I'm a rapist!
What are you?
You don't need to use protection, you are all good.
You don't need protection… You're all good.

Call me Ravenclaw because I'll keep your owl away.
Can I join you in my house?
Come to my bedroom, I have a long bed with a waterfall for you to munch on!
Did I mention it's made of Bone?
Did you fart?
Did you hear about the Potter war? I heard Horcruxes got rolled in there.
Do you want to use those unforgettables on me?
Do you want to touch my Azkaban?
Don't tell anyone, but I have a thing for girls with short red hair.
Fancy joining me in bed, it'll give you permission to touch me
Girl, when you were younger, I didn't think you'd ever notice me, but now I'm a Slytherin, and it's clear you've got something in common with me.
Have you ever had a Pestilence Curse? (Which one?) Me!
Hagrid's not the only giant on campus!
I can show you a Dark Lord... with better props
I have a great idea for a Gryffindor-themed club... you won't be a Slytherin, and I won't be a Gryffindor.
I like you, you like me, and it looks like we have something in common.
I lost my wand, think I'm going to have to ask you to forgive me
I must be in Azkaban, because I can't hold my hotness back any time.
I want to bite you like you do to basilisks.
I want to have a real Azkaban - if you know what I mean.
I want to eat you out like a pig does to a frog.
I want to have a real Azkaban - you won't believe what I have in store for you tonight.
I'd bring you to St. Mungo's but you'd get St. Mungo's friends.

I'm sorry, I suppose you forgot your robes.
This may not be your traditional bedtime, but you could be the change that knocks tonight.
Tonight we're coming up on 50 years in office. We've all been there, two things strike me as particularly impressive about this century—the way things are going, the way things are changing. The only thing missing is you, my friend.
We have to make room for more people, though I won't be including you in my informal service.
What say you and me go upstairs and check out my private chambers?
Who needs a social worker when you can trust me to take care of you?
With great power comes great responsibility. You have the power to stop me if I screw you.
You have a beautiful body. I'd love to find out what you have to say about how I fuck it
I didn't know I was such a scholar that I could seduce you so easily.
Your body is a wonderland and I would like to be one of the 50 most beautiful people in the world.
They say we're fighting over-nutrition levels. I think I'm fighting over-women.
My eyes are glazed all over you.
You should let me be your Lego. I can build any structure you want.
Aren't you the smartest girl here?
I am going to melt in your mouth, not in your hand.
When you put your glasses on I can see a LOT.
Why don't you put on some deodorant and take off those cowboy boots. You look so good, you know that I am right up there with the smartest people I know.
If a chick tells you you have a great body, it's not real until she shows it.
If I told you, you had a nice little body, would you hold it against me?
My friend told me to come over and I think we can do it.
Pretty to see you in your 10 year dress.
She's the smartest, prettiest girl in the room.
Tell me why you're there and I'll tell you what: Your body is a wonderland and I'd like to be one of the 50 most beautiful people in the world.
Hey baby, give me a call
Hi, I'm Dana Brooke. My name's Dana.
Hey, I’ve heard you're pretty into threesomes, let's do it.
If I were a missile, I’d hit you with my bazooka first.
Cinna a latte?
Can I add you on Skype?
Nice car. I want to crash into you, but I’m a little drunk and I don’t know if you’re sober.
So uh, hello. I'd like to invite you to my place. Can I have a date?
That threesome is pretty hot. I bet it would taste even better after we swallow this joint.
There are only two words that I’ve ever wanted to say to my mouth: love you!
We just had to meet up because you are A-OK.
What is the difference between sexy and delicious? I’ve learned to ignore the stupid-ass posters and focus on the sex.
You are a soul-mate
You don’t need SINCE.
You don’t need to use a sign language.
You have a nice car. You look great in that hailing limo, you should drive it home with me.
You make me melt.
Your stethoscope or my heart attack?

Do you have a laptop I could borrow? I need to type something into your email address.
Do you have a Pen-Pen or Wrench?
Does your father drive a Porsche? He must be a fine jeweler.
Excuse me, miss, I think you're missing an ear drum.
Girl, when you do it with me it’s like lightning.
Haven't you ever been laid in peace?
Hey baby, do you prefer a sled?
Hey girl, you're the finest girl in class C, let’s be cousins.
Hey girl, you're like an ES&S... I wanna flex you all over
Hey girl, you can keep the oil in your car
I don’t know how I’ll ever get to class D in time, but I’ll try my best.
What do you say we get out of here and enjoy the weekend?
What's your ideal smoking experience?
What's your pet peeve?
Where can I buy 10 of them?
What's your favorite time of the year?
Why don't you be my 15th guest?
Why don't you go out with me and find out what's on the menu?
Would you like to witness the Quick Change and pick up some weed?
Would you like to ring in the new year with a bang?
Would you like to host a bbq and get high together?
Would you like to celebrate New Years Eve in my little Jewish synagogue?
You can't get me high on hallucinogens like the popular saying goes, but you can!
You can't get me high on Shabbos like the popular saying goes, but you can!
You can't tell me what's kosher for the Jewish calendar, but you sure can tell me what's not!
You just gave me super-seed!
You smell good.
You put the 'Rosh Hashanah' in shabbos
You'd make a great rabbi. You should be celebrating Shabbos with me!
You'll be waking me from a 24-hour slumber (Midrash Tishuv).
You'll be waking me from a Superimposed Bed.
You'll be waking me from a Superimposed Shabbos.
You'll find I am capable of facing all kinds of challenges, from the Dead to the comically dead.
You've no idea how many times I've told you, 'You must be from the dead'…
All those questions make me want to leave again…
Are you a customer? Because I'd pay good money to see you again.
Are you a knife? Because I'll cut you if you'll go down with me.
Are you tired? Because you've been running through my mind all day!
Are you impressed with the workmanship of this knife? Because it looks great!
Are you enjoying your buns, or are you just happy to see me?
Baby, you're a fine piece of artisan jewelry!
Baby, you’re as fine as jewelry.
